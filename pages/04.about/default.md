###About

TechniSolutions provides solutions for your online technical needs. We aim for using the [best practices](http://www.bestpractice.technology/) available that would make sure your needs are satisfied & stay that way.

We started supporting & maintaining computers back when not everyone knew what the Internet even was (yes, that was back in the mid-1990's by the way ðŸ™‚). Since then we've soaked up a good variety of experience which makes it so we know of what you may need even if we need to work with other outside parties to get all the parts of the plan to fit together just right. We're definitely not afraid to just jump in & figure it out as we're working with you though.

Now the main one that gets & keeps things going here is [Joshua Reynolds](mailto:j@techni.solutions) but he'll answer to Josh or J_Rey just the same. You may meet the other guys later on if appropriate. So [contact us](/contact) however you'd like & we'll be glad to help.
