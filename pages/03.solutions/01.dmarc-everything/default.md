###E-mail Spoofing Protection

All the major e-mail providers have been using DMARC and for good reason. 

DMARC is an official standard that domain owners use to specify exactly which e-mails are actually from them. Most junk e-mail is forged and  trying to send you spam to buy something, trick you into a phishing scheme or including some malware/virus so they can use & abuse your systems. Protect yourself and others by both listing what e-mails are okay from your domain & filtering the e-mails you receive for what other domains are saying about theirs.
